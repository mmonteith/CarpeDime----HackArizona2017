CarpeDime
-----------------------------------
A money management app designed for college students at Hack Arizona 2017. It keeps track of their
income and portions out their funds based on how much they want to save and spend. Users are
able to add end spending reports, and based on their frequency, CarpeDime helps them decide
when the best time is to "treat themselves".

Created by: Victor Gomes, Michelle Monteith, and Griffin Stiller.


Relevant Files
-----------------------------------
User.java                 our user object which keeps track of all their data.
Spending.java             an object that represents a purchase.
SpendingList.java         a list of spending objects and necessary functions.
GUI.java                  a not very functioning GUI, values were hardcoded for the presentation to get the idea across, but we were unable to have our classes function with the GUI.

Disclaimer: none of us had experience creating a GUI from scratch, so we based ours after previous
GUI's supplied by our professor, Rick Mercer, and used an Eclipse addon WindowBuilder to help create
it. All other files in this depository were generated by that addon.
